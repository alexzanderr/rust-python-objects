# Rust Python Objects
use python like objects in rust, such as `list`, for now.

have the `simplicity` and `performance` together.

be happy.


# why ?
why not. because python concepts are very cool, but python is slow..

so what if we could use python objects in rust and have the same experience as in python (almost) ?

and things are getting much better. rust has `zero-cost abstractions`, meaning that every struct and trait will be deleted at `compile time` and they will be gone at `runtime`.

so we are getting python objects in rust with `performance` and `simplity`.

# NOTE

note for the user and developer

right now this project is very minimal, it will grow, the idea just came to my mind some days ago (on 21.02.2022) and the first implementation was done at 4 AM (23.02.2022) with some adrenaline.

so for now dont expect too much of this crate

peace to you!
